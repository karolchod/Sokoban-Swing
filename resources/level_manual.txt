This is an example of making file with new game level.
Levels are stored in 'poziom x.txt' files, where x is level number.
Total number of levels must be changed also in 'config.properties' file.

Square definition explaination:
0-floor
1-wall 
2-player start position
3-box position 
4-box destination
5-door activator
6-door 
7-square with bonus

Levels are rotated 90 degrees than what is in files, but it does not affect game experience.
